The applicationâ€™s intent is to demonstrate upgradeability approach in smart contracts to support multiple implementations in the factory contract without the necessity of redeploying the entire contract set.\n\n## Demo & Testing on Polygon Amoy\n\nYou can test the contract functionality using a deployed demo UI on the Polygon Amoy testnet:\n\n* **Demo UI:** [https://ksvirsky.github.io/payment-escrow-demo/](https://ksvirsky.github.io/payment-escrow-demo/)\n\n### Deployed Contract Addresses on Polygon Amoy:\n\n* **PaymentEscrowFactory Address:** `0x9a91dCbf35E5a8d929970A1c81aCcAa8875764Ec`\n* **Mock ERC-20 Token Contract:** `0xD629B37f222deDE7e405f2a4aA678C6423e3b9b7`\n\nTo obtain mock tokens for testing:\n* Use the `mint(address, uint)` method on the Mock ERC-20 token contract.\n* **Convenient Minting Tool:** [https://ksvirsky.github.io/c-evm-exec?chainId=80002&address=0xD629B37f222deDE7e405f2a4aA678C6423e3b9b7&signature=mint%28address+a%2C+uint256+amount%29&args=0xYourAddress%2C+1000000000000000000000000&mode=write](https://ksvirsky.github.io/c-evm-exec?chainId=80002&address=0xD629B37f222deDE7e405f2a4aA678C6423e3b9b7&signature=mint%28address+a%2C+uint256+amount%29&args=0xYourAddress%2C+1000000000000000000000000&mode=write)\n    *(Remember to replace `0xYourAddress` in the `args` with your actual Polygon Amoy wallet address when using the tool.)*"
